# AnimationPrepStudio-ArduGlove
DIY Arduino/SteamVR motion capture gloves for AnimationPrepStudio. 

Contains the files for assembling and programming a (super simple) "DIY" motion capture glove using an Arduino to read a SEN-08606 Flex Sensor 4.5" for each finger and a Vive tracker that is strapped to the 3D printed hand strap.

The laser cutter files are included to make the flex sensor sleeves.

The 3D printer files are include to make the hand strap that holds the Vive tracker.

The Arduino files are used to program the Arduino so it can communicate with AnimationPrepStudio via a Com port.

Two Arduino examples are show, one is a wired simple serial example, the other is the nRF24L01 wireless example.
